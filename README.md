In this project, the goal is to develop a machine learning model for predicting whether a patient has diabetes based on features such as Glucose level, Insulin, Age, and BMI. The initial step involves gathering a relevant dataset containing these features and a binary variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes. After obtaining the data, preprocessing steps are undertaken to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering. Subsequently, a variety of machine learning algorithms are chosen and trained on the dataset, with model performance evaluated using metrics like accuracy_score through techniques such as cross-validation.

Once the best-performing model is selected, the next phase involves deploying the model into a web application using Flask, a lightweight Python micro-framework. Serialization tools like pickle or joblib are used to save the trained model, and the Flask web app is designed to take user inputs (e.g., Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI) and provide real-time predictions. The web application includes a user-friendly interface for input handling and result display. Thorough testing and optimization are conducted to ensure the functionality and responsiveness of both the model and the web app.
